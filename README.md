# Mall Customer Segmentation
In this project I have used **K Means Clustering** Algorithm

The image is clearly showing the five different clusters with different colors. The clusters are formed between two parameters of the dataset; Annual income of customer and Spending. We can change the colors and labels as per the requirement or choice. We can also observe some points from the above patterns, which are given below:

* **Cluster1** shows the customers with average salary and average spending so we can categorize these customers as normal.
* **Cluster2** shows the customer has a high income but low spending, so we can categorize them as careful.
* **Cluster3** shows the low income and also low spending so they can be categorized as sensible.
* **Cluster4** shows the customers with low income with very high spending so they can be categorized as careless.
* **Cluster5** shows the customers with high income and high spending so they can be categorized as target, and these customers can be the most profitable customers for the mall owner.
